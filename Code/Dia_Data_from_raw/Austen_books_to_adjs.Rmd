## words as they are

first we get the data into phrases, converting the text to Latin1

then we use widyr to produce co-occurrances and correlations matrices for the corpus of books:

for each book

for the intersection of words used in each book

## words as stems

then we use `textclean` to clean up text.

We use `textstem` to stemmatise the words

then we use widyr to produce co-occurrances and correlations matrices for the corpus of books:

for each book

for the intersection of words used in each book

## words as lems

We use `textstem` to lemmatise the words

then we use widyr to produce co-occurrances and correlations matrices for the corpus of books:

for each book

for the intersection of words used in each book
